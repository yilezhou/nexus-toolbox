# 📦 Nexus-Toolbox

A collection of high-impact technical tools and AI prompt patterns for Senior Technical Advisors. Curated and maintained by Michael as part of the **Sentinel Nexus** project.

## 🛠️ Included Tools

### [Migration-Squash](./tools/migration-squash)
Consolidate messy, incremental SQL migration folders into a single "Source of Truth" `init.sql`. Bypasses AI-generated technical debt in Lovable, Bolt, and v0 projects.

## 🛡️ The Sentinel Nexus Methodology
We believe that as AI builders evolve, the role of the Technical Advisor shifts from *writing* code to *orchestrating state*. These tools help maintain that orchestration.
